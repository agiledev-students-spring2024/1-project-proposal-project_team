# Project Proposal: Music Match


### What & Why?
The software system I'd like to build this semester is an app that locates and shares live music events around NYC. 
I personally love the experience of hearing live music and often I stumble upon musicians whether in a bar, jazz club, or even at Washington Square Park. I would love a way to find more opportunities to lsiten to live music at any moment, and I think that many others would have use for this kind of app.


### For Whom?
This app would be created for music fans like myself, as well as musicians who can use it to promote themselves, grow their audience, and gain a following. From jazz, to rock, to pianists in the park, live music can be for all types of people at different ages and with different musical preferences. This app also encourages people to seek in-person encounters and engage with others with similar interests.


### How?
From an end-users perspecive, this app will simply show live music events spearated into three sections: past, current(today), and upcoming. Each event will have a short description, a location, a time, and price (if applicable). Users will also have the option to select preferences such as type of music (jazz, rock, rap, instrumental, etc.), location(indoor, outfoor, bar(if 21+), venue, etc.). 
Users will also be able to submit a live music event (either as an audience member, musician, store/bar owner, etc.). Each posting may also have the option to upload photos and links to webistes or music platforms.


### Scope
In order to make this app fully functioning, user friendly, with a nicely designed interface, amd populated with live music events, it will take a good amount of work/time from multiple students over the course of the semester. As beginners I do think this will be a challenge, but I don't think it is too ambitious as we can work together and ask questions.
